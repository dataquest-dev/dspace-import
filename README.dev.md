# How to write new tests
Check test.example package. Everything necessary should be there.

Test data are in `test/data` folder.
If your test data contains special characters like čřšáý and so on, it is recommended
to make `.stripped` variation of the file. 
E.g. `my_format.json` and `my_format.stripped.json` for loading data
and `my_format.test.xml` and `my_format.test.stripped.xml` for testing.

If not on dev-5 (e.g. when run on localhost), `.stripped` version of files will be loaded.
The reason for this is, that when dspace runs on windows, it has trouble with special characters.


## Settings
See const.py for constants used at testing.

To set up logs, navigate to support.logs.py and modify method set_up_logging.

## Run

In order to run tests, use command
`python -m unittest`

Recommended variation is
`python -m unittest -v 2> output.txt`
which leaves result in output.txt

Before running for the first time, requirements must be installed with following command
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

It is possible to run in Pycharm with configuration like so:

# How to re-initialize dspace 7 database

Recreate your local CLARIN-DSpace7.* database **NOTE: all data will be deleted**

- Install again the database following the official tutorial steps: https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/Installing+DSpace#InstallingDSpace-PostgreSQL11.x,12.xor13.x(withpgcryptoinstalled)
- Or try to run these commands in the <PSQL_PATH>/bin:
> - `createdb --username=postgres --owner=dspace --encoding=UNICODE dspace` // create database
> - `psql --username=postgres dspace -c "CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;"` // Add pgcrypto extension
> > If it throws warning that `-c` parameter was ignored, just write a `CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;` command in the database cmd.
> > CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
